The cost of one type of mobile service is Rs. 250 plus Rs. 1.25 for each call made over and above 100 calls. Write a C program to read customer codes and calls made and print the bill for each customer.
#include <stdio.h>
main()
{
    int customerCode, calls;
    float bill;

    printf("Enter customer code: ");
    scanf("%d", &customerCode);

    printf("Enter number of calls made: ");
    scanf("%d", &calls);
    if (calls <= 100)
    {
        bill = 250;
    }
    else
    {
        bill = 250 + 1.25 * (calls - 100);
    }
    printf("Customer Code: %d\n", customerCode);
    printf("Total Bill: Rs. %.2f\n", bill);
}
